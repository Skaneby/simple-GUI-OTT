# Simple-GUI-OTT
As excel and similar is the most used form specifying OTT profiles this project will enable a faster workflow to recieve sample files for a OTT specification.
By creating an web formula where common parameters like with, height, bitrate , codec and profile is defined, we can easily use these paramaters as variable in a transcoder settings XML and start a teset job. This example project / app will target FFMPEg as a POC.
